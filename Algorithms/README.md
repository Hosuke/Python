Some of the Python code examples import shared Python files. 
Thus, it is better to download all the code into a local directory before running. 
When executed individually, each Python source file will run its test script. 
For example "python binary_heap.py" will run the binary heap test. 
Alternatively, running "python test.py" will run all the test scripts automatically.
